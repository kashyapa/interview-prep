# Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets, and your goal
# is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
#
# You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started. You will pick one fruit from each tree
# until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
#
# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
