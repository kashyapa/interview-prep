# There is a dictionary containing words from an alien language for which we donâ€™t know the ordering of the alphabets. Write a method to find the correct order of the alphabets in the alien language. It is given that the input is a valid dictionary and there exists an ordering among its alphabets.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: Words: ["ba", "bc", "ac", "cab"]
# Output: bac
# Explanation: Given that the words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of the alien language, so
# from the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:
#
# 1. From "ba" and "bc", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'c'.
# 2. From "bc" and "ac", we can conclude that 'b' comes before 'a'
#
# From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "bac"
