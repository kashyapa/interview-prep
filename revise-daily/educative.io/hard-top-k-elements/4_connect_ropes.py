# Given â€˜Nâ€™ ropes with different lengths, we need to connect these ropes into one big rope with minimum cost.
# The cost of connecting two ropes is equal to the sum of their lengths.


# Input: [1, 3, 11, 5]
# Output: 33
# Explanation: First connect 1+3(=4), then 4+5(=9), and then 9+11(=20). So the total cost is 33 (4+9+20)
