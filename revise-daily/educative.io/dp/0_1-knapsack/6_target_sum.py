# Given a set of positive numbers (non zero) and a target sum ‘S’. Each number should be assigned either a ‘+’ or ‘-’ sign. We need to find out total ways to assign symbols to make the sum of numbers equal to target ‘S’.


# This problem follows the 0/1 Knapsack pattern and can be converted into Count of Subset Sum. Let’s dig into this.
#
# We are asked to find two subsets of the given numbers whose difference is equal to the given target ‘S’. Take the first example above. As we saw, one solution is {+1-1-2+3}. So, the two subsets we are asked to find are {1, 3} & {1, 2} because,
#
#     (1 + 3) - (1 + 2 ) = 1
# Now, let’s say ‘Sum(s1)’ denotes the total sum of set ‘s1’, and ‘Sum(s2)’ denotes the total sum of set ‘s2’. So the required equation is:
#
#     Sum(s1) - Sum(s2) = S
# This equation can be reduced to the subset sum problem. Let’s assume that ‘Sum(num)’ denotes the total sum of all the numbers, therefore:
#
#     Sum(s1) + Sum(s2) = Sum(num)
# Let’s add the above two equations:
#
#     => Sum(s1) - Sum(s2) + Sum(s1) + Sum(s2) = S + Sum(num)
#     => 2 * Sum(s1) =  S + Sum(num)
#     => Sum(s1) = (S + Sum(num)) / 2
# This essentially converts our problem to: “Find count of subsets of the given numbers whose sum is equal to”,
#
#     => (S + Sum(num)) / 2
