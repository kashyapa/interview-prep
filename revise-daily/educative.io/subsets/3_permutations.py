# Given a set of distinct numbers, find all of its permutations.
#
# Permutation is defined as the re-arranging of the elements of the set. For example, {1, 2, 3} has the following six permutations:
#
# {1, 2, 3}
# {1, 3, 2}
# {2, 1, 3}
# {2, 3, 1}
# {3, 1, 2}
# {3, 2, 1}
# If a set has ‘n’ distinct elements it will have n!n! permutations.

# Input: [1,3,5]
# Output: [1,3,5], [1,5,3], [3,1,5], [3,5,1], [5,1,3], [5,3,1]
